## Smart Bottle_Project
## Project Overview:
The Smart Bottle for Health Care is an IoT-based hydration monitoring system aimed at encouraging individuals to maintain optimal hydration levels. By integrating sensor technology with real-time alerts and cloud connectivity, this project tracks water consumption and provides timely reminders, promoting a healthier lifestyle through consistent hydration.

## Problem Statement:
Hydration is often overlooked due to busy schedules, forgetfulness, or lack of awareness. This project addresses such psychological barriers by providing a smart, sensor-driven solution that tracks intake and notifies users, helping them build a conscious and healthy hydration habit.

## Features:
- Water Level Detection: Waterproof Ultrasonic Sensor accurately measures water level in the bottle.

- Environmental Sensing: DHT11 sensor monitors temperature and humidity.

- Real-Time Display: 16x2 LCD shows humidity and temperature data live.

- Smart Alerts: Buzzer and Telegram Bot send notifications when water intake is insufficient.

- WiFi Connectivity: Uses NodeMCU (ESP8266) for connecting to the internet and pushing data to the cloud.

## Existing Solutions & Improvements:
Earlier smart bottles focused on basic temperature tracking. This version introduces integrated hydration alerts and messaging via Telegram, making it more interactive and proactive for users.

## Target Audience:
- Fitness Enthusiasts

- Office Professionals

- Students

- Elderly or Medically Needy

- Health-Conscious Individuals

## Components Used:
Step1: NodeMCU ESP8266 – WiFi-enabled microcontroller

Step2: DHT11 Sensor – For temperature and humidity monitoring

Step3: Waterproof Ultrasonic Sensor – For water level tracking

Step4: 16x2 I2C LCD – For real-time display

Step5: Buzzer – For audio alerts

Step6: Telegram Bot – Sends notification messages

Step7: Power Cables, Jumper Wires, Bottle Mount Setup

## Hardware Setup:
Step1: Connect DHT11 to the ESP8266 (D5 pin).

Step2: Connect Ultrasonic Sensor (Trig → D3, Echo → D4).

Step3: Connect buzzer to D8.

Step4: Connect and configure the I2C LCD to ESP8266.

Step5: Secure sensors and NodeMCU to a stainless-steel water bottle.

## Software Setup:
- Install Arduino IDE.

- Add necessary libraries:

- DHT.h

- LiquidCrystal_I2C.h

- ESP8266WiFi.h

- UniversalTelegramBot.h

- ArduinoJson.h

- Upload the .ino code to the NodeMCU.

- Set up Telegram bot using BotFather and note the bot token and chat ID.

## Usage:
- Turn on the device.

- Bottle begins monitoring water levels and environmental data.

- If water isn't consumed in a set time, a buzzer alert is triggered.

- Telegram message is sent to notify the user.

- Temperature and humidity are displayed on the LCD screen.

## Future Enhancements:
- Mobile App Integration for hydration analytics and notification customization.

- AI-Based Suggestions for personalized hydration plans.

-  Advanced Sensor Integration to monitor additional health parameters (e.g., motion sensors to detect drinking action).

-  Battery Operation for full portability.

## Conclusion:
The Smart Bottle for Health Care blends modern IoT technology with practical health benefits. It empowers users to take control of their hydration habits and overall wellness, making it a valuable addition to everyday life.
