Smart Bottle_Project
Project Overview:
The Smart Bottle for Health Care is an IoT-based hydration monitoring system aimed at encouraging individuals to maintain optimal hydration levels. By integrating sensor technology with real-time alerts and cloud connectivity, this project tracks water consumption and provides timely reminders, promoting a healthier lifestyle through consistent hydration.

❓ Problem Statement:
Hydration is often overlooked due to busy schedules, forgetfulness, or lack of awareness. This project addresses such psychological barriers by providing a smart, sensor-driven solution that tracks intake and notifies users, helping them build a conscious and healthy hydration habit.

✨ Features:
Water Level Detection: Waterproof Ultrasonic Sensor accurately measures water level in the bottle.

Environmental Sensing: DHT11 sensor monitors temperature and humidity.

Real-Time Display: 16x2 LCD shows humidity and temperature data live.

Smart Alerts: Buzzer and Telegram Bot send notifications when water intake is insufficient.

WiFi Connectivity: Uses NodeMCU (ESP8266) for connecting to the internet and pushing data to the cloud.

🔄 Existing Solutions & Improvements:
Earlier smart bottles focused on basic temperature tracking. This version introduces integrated hydration alerts and messaging via Telegram, making it more interactive and proactive for users.

🎯 Target Audience:
Fitness Enthusiasts

Office Professionals

Students

Elderly or Medically Needy

Health-Conscious Individuals
